## About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on full-stack web development. Currently, I'm honing my skills at Gearbox, where I delve into various technologies to build robust web applications. My expertise lies in Go and Angular, along with their associated ecosystems. I have experience deploying and maintaining applications at scale in AWS.

## GitHub Contributions

While my day-to-day work primarily resides in [private repositories on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cody.potter), I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Most of my contributions involve addressing bugs encountered during my work and sharing snippets of code to help improve the community's codebase.

## Projects

Here are some noteworthy projects I've been working on:

- [XCode Coverage Utility](https://github.com/codypotter/coverage-dashboard): A code coverage analyzer for your iOS project.
- [Itty Bitty Social](https://github.com/codypotter/itty-bitty-social): A very minimal backend example of how to set up your social networking backend in Go. This was used as an example in [this blog post](https://loficode.com/posts/go-layered-architecture).
- [Itty Bitty IRC](https://github.com/codypotter/itty-bitty-irc): This was a student project written in node.js to implment a minimal client and server application based on the IRC protocol.
- And a ton of private stuff I cannot discuss.
